# Contributing to @web-kits/audio

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+ (enforced via `engines` in `package.json`)
- **pnpm** 9+

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raphaelsalaja/audio.git
cd audio
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## Development

```bash
# Start all apps and packages in dev mode
pnpm dev

# Build everything
pnpm build

# Typecheck
pnpm typecheck

# Lint
pnpm lint
```

## Monorepo layout

```
packages/audio       Core library + CLI
apps/web             Documentation site (Fumadocs)
ui/                  Shared UI components
.web-kits/           First-party sound patches & generated code
```

## Making changes

1. Create a new branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Run `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` to verify everything passes.
4. Add a changeset describing your change (see below).
5. Open a pull request.

## Changesets

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and changelogs. Before opening a PR that affects the published package, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Follow the prompts to describe what changed and the semver bump type. This creates a markdown file in `.changeset/` that gets consumed during release.

## Commit convention

Commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). A `commitlint` hook enforces this automatically.

Format: `<type>(<optional scope>): <description>`

### Types

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | Add, adjust, or remove a feature |
| `fix` | Fix a bug |
| `refactor` | Restructure code without changing behavior |
| `perf` | Performance improvement (special refactor) |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, semicolons — no behavior change |
| `test` | Add or correct tests |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `build` | Build tools, dependencies, project version |
| `ops` | Infrastructure, deployment, CI/CD, backups |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks like `.gitignore`, initial commit |

### Rules

- Use imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Do not capitalize the first letter of the description
- No period at the end
- Append `!` after the type for breaking changes: `feat!: remove status endpoint`

### Examples

```
feat: add bandpass filter type
fix(envelope): resolve attack timing drift
refactor: extract audio context into shared module
perf: cache frequency calculations in oscillator
docs: add patch authoring guide
build: update typescript to v6
chore: init
```

See the full [Conventional Commits Cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) for more details.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Include a clear description of what changed and why.
- Make sure CI passes before requesting review.
- If your change affects the public API, include a changeset.

## Sound patches

To contribute a first-party sound patch:

1. Run `npx @web-kits/audio init` to scaffold a patch in `.web-kits/`.
2. Follow the patch schema and add sound definitions.
3. Include well-named, well-tuned sound definitions.
4. Open a PR with a brief description of the patch.
